neXtSIM-DG model
================

The neXt-generation Sea Ice Model (neXtSIM) using Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) numerics has been developed in the `SASIP <https://sasip-climate.github.io/>`_ project.

NEDAS now supports this new model for performing data assimilation.
A collection of Jupyter notebooks are available from the `2025 neXtSIM workshop <https://github.com/sasip-climate/notebooks-nextsim-workshop2025>`_.

The `demo-osse.ipynb <https://github.com/sasip-climate/notebooks-nextsim-workshop2025/blob/main/assimilation/demo-osse.ipynb>`_ notebook demonstrates step by step how to setup and run an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) in neXtSIM-DG using NEDAS.
