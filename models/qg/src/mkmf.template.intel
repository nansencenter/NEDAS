# To create a makefile called Makefile and immediately exectute it, thus producing an
# executable called sqg4.0, cut and paste the following line:
#
# mkmf -x -v -p qg2.93 -t mkmf.template.intel path_names  > mkmf.log
#
# or if you have mpif.h in your src directory and you don't want to execute the make command:
#
# mkmf -p qg2.93 -t mkmf.template.intel path_names 
#
# (be sure not to have exactly one carriage return per path name in path_names...  
# otherwise you get a parsing error from mkmf)
