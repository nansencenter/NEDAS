In the scripts/ directory you'll find four executable scripts,
all of which should be oh so useful.

> cleandata <directory>

-Removes all ouput generated by SQG in <directory>, but leaves
input.nml alone.  Useful for clearing old data in tests, but be 
careful not to destroy good data!  (that's why its a long command)

> runqg

-GSUB script for submitting a batch job to the T90s at GFDL.  You will
need to modify this.

> format_input.pl <restart file>  ******Overwrites old file!!******

-Converts a restart.nml file to a form readable by BOTH you AND
the computer..  (lower cases correctly, removes white space in
long empty strings, adds newlines in the right places, etc...)
